## CS 230 – The Gaming Room Software Design

### **Who was the client? What did they want?**
The client was **The Gaming Room**. They had a game called *Draw It or Lose It* for Android and wanted to expand it into a web-based, cross-platform version that could work on Windows, Mac, Linux, and browsers.

### **What did you do well?**
I explained how to manage memory, enforce unique names, and keep a single game instance using design patterns like **Singleton** and **Iterator**. I kept things organized and clear.

### **What helped with coding later?**
Planning everything in the document helped a lot. It gave me a better understanding of how each part of the game should connect and work together before I even started writing code.

### **What would you change?**
I’d go back and improve the platform comparison part. I could’ve added more specific examples and clearer reasons for my choices.

### **How did you handle the user’s needs?**
I made sure the game would work well on different devices and that game state and naming were consistent. Thinking about the players helped me design something more solid and user-friendly.

### **What was your approach to designing?**
I used object-oriented principles and broke things down into smaller parts like services and classes. In the future, I’d also use mockups and more diagrams to help visualize the system better.
